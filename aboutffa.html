    <h2>About the FFA Organization</h2>
    <p><b>The National FFA Organization</b> prepares members for leadership and career success through agricultural education. Founded in 1928, FFA today serves hundreds of thousands of students across all 50 states, including right here in Claude, Texas.</p>
